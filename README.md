## Project Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Imported dataset and handled missing values.
   - Converted categorical values into numerical form for analysis.
   - Created new time-based features for deeper insights.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualized delivery time distribution.
   - Examined the relationship between traffic, weather, and delivery time.
   - Analyzed peak order times and order distribution by city.

3. **Feature Engineering**
   - Added new features like `pickup_duration` and `order_day_name`.
   - Created bins for delivery time categories (Fast, Normal, Delayed).

4. **Findings & Insights**
   - Documented key observations to help Zomato improve operations.

## Expected Insights

- **Festival Impact**: Delivery time increases significantly during festivals.
- **Weather Conditions**: Foggy and cloudy conditions result in slightly longer delivery times.
- **Traffic Influence**: High traffic density leads to increased delivery time.
- **Order Timing**: Peak order hours impact delivery efficiency.
- **Multiple Deliveries**: More deliveries in a single trip affect overall delivery time.

This analysis helps Zomato enhance operational efficiency, optimize delivery time, and improve customer satisfaction. ðŸš€
